## Exercise 2 Use Cloud Integration capablity for event mediation
In this exercise, an Integration Flow is added as a consumer via the Advanced Event Mesh adapter using the Solace Messaging Format (SMF). Integration flows can be used to mediate events, for example, to perform message transformation or protocol conversion steps.

## 2.1 Setup REST Endpoint

Before we start building our integration flow, we will "provision" a simple HTTP endpoint where we will send the message.

### webhook.site (HTTP endpoint)

For simplicity purposes, our REST consumer will be a simple HTTP endpoint that will receive the messages from the queue. We will use a tool called [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to create a temporary endpoint that will receive the messages. When you navigate to the website, you will be presented with a unique URL that you can use to receive the messages. **Take note of the unique URL** as we will use it to configure the REST consumer.
