## Exercise 3: Incremental growth: Add web application as additional consumer


The publish-subscribe pattern decouples the sending and receiving applications. This makes it easy to add new applications allows for incremental growth. In this exercise a web application is added as additional consumer. The web application is subscribed to a queue and lists all business partners.

## Exercise 3.1: Create new queue for additional application

1. Go back to the original tab in your browser and click on **"Cluster Manager"** on the left.
2. In the All Services screen click on the **"Broker Asia"** tile.

> **_HINT:_** If you cannot see the tiles, uncheck the "Only show my services" box.

## Exercise 3.3: Publish event to topic

In exercise 1, we did publish event to a queue. This time the event will be published to a topic instead. All queues subscribed to the topic will receive the event. This means both of your queues will receive events from all participants.

1. Switch back to the Broker Instance and open the **"Try me tool"**.  If your Broker is not connected, plese repeat the steps 14-19 of exercise 1.4 [Exercise 1.4 - Send an event from the Try Me! Tool to your Topic](../ex1#exercise-14---send-an-event-from-the-try-me-tool-to-your-topic)

3. For the message content change the **"BusinessPartner"** value UserXXX to your User ID, e.g. **"User000"**. Press "**Publish**""
```json
